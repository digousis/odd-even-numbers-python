# odd-even-numbers-python
This is an example about printing odd or even numbers in python.

There is a csv file with name "numbers". The file contains only one collumn with numbers (there is no title). 

The python code import this file and print the even or odd numbers. Furthermore, another python code counts the odds and even numbers and creates a pie chart with their percentages.
